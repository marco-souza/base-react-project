## Running the app with docker-compose

The best way to run this application it's by using docker-compose. Use the following steps to run it in your machine.

### App requirements

Install:

- `docker`

Check the `docker` vs `docker-compose` [compatibility matrix](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#compatibility-matrix) to make sure your running version of docker supports the compose version specified in `./docker-compose.yml` at the root of this repo.

### How to?

After installing the packages mentioned above in your system you use the following commands: 

```sh
# Run in development mode
docker-compose up

# Run only the app
docker-compose up app

# To build a local image of the app
docker build -t devopness .

# Then run it
docker run devopness
```
Access the running app
The app container will be listening to HTTP requests on port 9000.
