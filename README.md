## App requirements
`docker`
`docker-compose`

Check the `docker` vs `docker-compose` [compatibility matrix](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#compatibility-matrix) to make sure your running version of docker supports the compose version specified in `./docker-compose.yml` at the root of this repo.

## How to?

### Run the app
`docker-compose up app`

### Access the running app
The app container will be listening to HTTP requests on port 9000.
Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000`
